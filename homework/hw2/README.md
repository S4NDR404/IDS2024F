2. Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.
3. Digital systems use binary (0s and 1s) which map directly to integer values.
4. CPU register.
5. Hard Disk Drive (HDD).
6. Bit.
7. a. assembly language.
   b. yes
8. a. Fortran.
   b. about seven decades old (created in the 1950s).
9. a. Assembly.
    b. Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, and R.
10. C was created in the 1970s, C++ in the 1980s, and MATLAB/Python in the 1990s.
11. B programming language.
12. C programming language.
13. The ancestor of MATLAB is Fortran, and the ancestor of Python is ABC.
14. CPU.
15. bit.
16. Access to register memory is about 100 times faster than access to RAM.
17. Access to RAM is typically 10 to 100 times faster than SSDs.
18. Access to RAM is 100 to 1000 times faster than HDDs.
19. to act as switches and amplifiers in circuits, controlling the flow of electrical signals.
20. Adding more transistors faces physical limits like heat dissipation and power consumption, which prevent indefinite performance improvements.
21. tasks accomplished within a CPU cycle are fetch, decode, and execute.
22. Yes, a powerful computer with more CPU cycles can be slower if other factors, like memory access, become bottlenecks.
23. The bottleneck speed in modern computers is memory access because CPU speeds have outpaced memory speeds.
24. Dennard scaling refers to scaling down transistors while maintaining performance efficiency, MOSFET scaling is the physical shrinking of transistors, and Moore's law predicts the doubling of transistor density approximately every two years.
