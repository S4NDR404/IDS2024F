1. This is not a question  
2. The requested README file is located [here](./../../README.md)  
3. a. Local Version Control Systems: Track versions on a single computer, typically using simple databases or directories (e.g., RCS). Only the local machine holds the version history.  
   b. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): Use a central server to store all file versions, with clients that check out files from this server (e.g., CVS, Subversion). Everyone collaborates through a single, shared repository.  
   c. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): Each user has a full copy of the repository, including the complete history of all files (e.g., Git, Mercurial). Collaboration occurs by exchanging changes between repositories.    
4. DVCS is considered the best because it offers  
      a. Resilience: Each user has a full copy of the repository, reducing the risk of data loss.  
      b. Offline work: Developers can work without a network connection, commit changes locally, and synchronize later.  
      c. Improved collaboration: DVCS supports non-linear workflows (branching, merging) more easily, which is crucial in modern, large-scale development projects.  
      d. Faster operations: Local operations are quicker since the entire history is on the user's machine.
5. a. For syncing your local with the remote repository.  
   b. Displays the state of the working directory, showing changes that have been staged, changes that haven't, and files that aren't tracked.  
   c. Stages all changes in the working directory (including new, modified, and deleted files) for the next commit.  
   d. Commits the changes to the repository with a message ("latest build" in this case) describing the commit.  
   e. To push all your commits from the local repository to the remote repository, to place them permanently there and be able to share them with others, use.  
6. [hw](./../../homework) [quiz](./../../quiz) [exam](./../../exam)
7. a.  
   b. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure  
   c. A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current directory, while an absolute path provides the full, exact location of a file or directory starting from the root directory.
