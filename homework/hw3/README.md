1. Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data.
2. Climate Modeling simulates Earth's climate using large amounts of data to predict future climate changes and study global warming. Bioinformatics uses algorithms and computational tools to analyze biological data. Financial Modeling predicts market trends and analyzes financial data.
3. Inductive Reasoning: Involves making generalizations based on specific observations. Example: "Every swan I’ve seen is white, therefore all swans must be white." Deductive Reasoning: Involves drawing a specific conclusion from general principles or premises. Example: "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal."
4. Observational data is an approximation of reality, potentially affected by measurement errors or limitations, while reality itself is objective and unchanging.
5. Reality, data, scenario.
6. A statement that can be either true or false.
7. No, a proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time. Example: "The cat is on the mat." This statement cannot be both true and false under the same conditions.
8. No, this is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Example: "If it is raining, the ground will be wet. However, just because the ground is wet, it doesn’t mean it is necessarily raining; it could have been wet by a sprinkler."

12. Logical Implication (Not Physical Causation): If the grass is wet, it must have rained. However, the wet grass could also be due to a sprinkler system (B could occur without A).
13. Propositions:  
    a. The man is wearing a mask.  
    b. The man is crawling out of a broken window.  
    c. The man is carrying a bag full of jewelry.  
Reasoning Process (Modus Ponens):  
    a.Premise 1: If someone is crawling out of a broken window with a bag of jewelry, they are likely a burglar (B ∧ C -> D).  
    b. Premise 2: The man is crawling out of a broken window with a bag of jewelry (B ∧ C).  
Conclusion: Therefore, the man is a burglar (D).

    b. Represents the simplest possible distinction between two states, such as true/false, or 0/1.  
    c. 1. 2^1 = 2 total possibilities, 0,1.  
      2. 2^2 = 4 total possibilities, 00,01,10,11.  
      3. 2^3 = 8 total possibilities, 000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111.
