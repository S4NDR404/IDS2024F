1. Observational Data are measurements collected during observation, errors, biases, and limitations can influence them. Reality (Truth) is the true underlying state of the world, independent of measurement or perception.
2. Aesthetics in Data Visualization are visual properties used to represent data and convey patterns effectively like position, color, size, shape, line type, transparency, and text.
3. THe more appropriate one is the purple to green as it is more visible to people who are color blind.
4. a.  Distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or other manufacturers of a certain product  
   b. represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed. In this case, we use a sequential color scale.  
   c.  visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.  
   d. highlight specific elements in the data.  
5. a. Valid, breathing inherently involves inhaling and exhaling.  
   b. Valid, "breathing" and "inhaling and exhaling" are interchangeable.  
   c. INvalid, consciousness, and breathing are not logically equivalent, as one can breathe without being conscious.  
   d. Invalid, consciousness is not strictly equivalent to breathing. Because consciousness requires brain activity, not just the act of breathing.  
   e. Invalid, rain implies clouds, but clouds do not always imply rain.  
   f. Invalid, rain does not guarantee the same conditions as cloudiness.  
6. Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data.  
7. No, Logical Implication: "If a fire alarm rings, people evacuate the building.", Physical Causation: "Smoke triggers the fire alarm."  
8. a. No, because it's linear without using the data in the blue to make the line.  
   b. historical reconstructions from indirect evidence introduce high uncertainty due to the lack of direct temperature measurements.  
   c. Yes, because it represents temperature anomalies recorded over time and each data corresponds to a specific year.  
   d. The rise is because of increased industrial activity and greenhouse gas emissions during and after World War II. The decline is due to post-war industrial activities.  
9. No, Representing probabilities with integer numbers would lose precision, as integers do not allow fractional values.  
10. Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers, Qualitative correspondence with common sense, and Consistency.  
11. a. 1 sub 10  
    b. 1 sub 10  
    c. 2 sub 10  
12. No, Computers use floating-point numbers which can approximate real numbers but cannot represent all of them due to limited memory.  
13. [question13](questions.jpeg)  
14. Git is a program that can be downloaded while GitHub is a web platform that's built on Git and making it easier to collaborate with others.  
15. Bayesian School of Probability allows the incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge through the use of prior probabilities, which are updated with evidence using Bayes' theorem.  
16. Bayesian school is most useful when data is scarce because it allows the incorporation of prior knowledge or beliefs to make inferences despite limited evidence.  
17. Frequentist school cannot define or discuss the probability of the existence of God because it interprets probability as the long run relative frequency of an event, which requires multiple experiments. Since the existence of God is not a repeatable or testable phenomenon, the Frequentist framework cannot make a meaningful probability of it.  
18. It's hard to understand the graph because the data isn't blocked off into specific age groups so it all kinda blends in together.
19. Integers provide a straightforward representation for binary states, and other data types.
20. B
21. Fortran

24. Deductive Reasoning: Derives specific conclusions from general premises. Example: "All humans are mortal. Socrates is human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." Inductive Reasoning: Derives general conclusions from specific observations. Example: "Every swan Iâ€™ve seen is white. Therefore, all swans are white."
25. they yield the same truth value for all possible combinations of their input variables. In other words, their truth tables are identical.

32. The two fundamental uncertainties in nature are epistemic uncertainty caused by a lack of knowledge and reducible with better information, and aleatory uncertainty which is intrinsic and arises from inherent randomness in processes like quantum mechanics.
