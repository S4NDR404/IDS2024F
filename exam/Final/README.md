1. Observational Data are measurements collected during observation, errors, biases, and limitations can influence them. Reality (Truth) is the true underlying state of the world, independent of measurement or perception.
2. Aesthetics in Data Visualization are visual properties used to represent data and convey patterns effectively like position, color, size, shape, line type, transparency, and text.
3. THe more appropriate one is the purple to green as it is more visible to people who are color blind.
4. a.  Distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or other manufacturers of a certain product  
   b. represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed. In this case, we use a sequential color scale.  
   c.  visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.  
   d. highlight specific elements in the data.  
5. a. Valid, breathing inherently involves inhaling and exhaling.  
   b. Valid, "breathing" and "inhaling and exhaling" are interchangeable.  
   c. INvalid, consciousness, and breathing are not logically equivalent, as one can breathe without being conscious.
   d. Invalid, consciousness is not strictly equivalent to breathing. Consciousness requires brain activity, not just the act of breathing.
   e. Invalid, rain implies clouds, but clouds do not always imply rain.
   f. Invalid, rain does not guarantee the same conditions as cloudiness.
6. Observation, Experimentation, Inference.
7. No, Logical Implication: "If a fire alarm rings, people evacuate the building.", Physical Causation: "Smoke triggers the fire alarm."
8. a. No, because it's linear without using the data in the blue to make the line.  
   b. historical reconstructions from indirect evidence introduce high uncertainty due to the lack of direct temperature measurements.  
   c. Yes, because it represents temperature anomalies recorded over time and each data corresponds to a specific year.  
   d. The rise is because increased industrial activity and greenhouse gas emissions during and after World War II. The decline is due to post-war industrial activities.
