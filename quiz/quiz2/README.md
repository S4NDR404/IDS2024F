28. A logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. For example, if (10^3 = 1000), then the logarithm of 1000 with base 10 is 3: (log10 (1000) = 3).  
29. a = 3, common difference d = 3, and the last term l = 99, number of terms n = 33. The sum is: S = n/2 * (a + l) = 33/2 * (3 + 99) = 33/2 * (102) = 1683.  
30. Magnetic tapes last 30-50 years compared to HDDs at 5-10 years.  
31. ENIAC.  
32. a = 1, d = 1, l = 100, n = 99, 100/2 * (1+100) = 50 * 101 = 5050 so S = 10^5050.
