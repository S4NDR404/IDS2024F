9. a. Working Directories: The area where the user modifies and edits project files.  
   b. Staging Area: A way to commit changes.    
   c. Local Repository: The area where committed parts of the project are stored, containing the full history of changes.  
10. A VCS is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to track, manage, and collaborate on projects by maintaining a history of file versions and changes.  
11. a. Backup**: Each client has a full copy of the project, ensuring redundancy.  
    b. Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on parallel branches simultaneously.  
    c. Non-linear Development: Easily manage multiple branches of development.  
    d. Speed**: Local operations (e.g., commits) are fast because they donâ€™t require communication with a central server.  
    e. No Single Point of Failure: If the central server goes down, any client repository can restore it.  
    f. Offline Access: Full project history is available offline, enabling users to work without internet access.  
12. a. Local VCS: Tracks file changes locally on a single computer.  
    b. Centralized VCS (CVCS): A central repository that all team members access (e.g., CVS, SVN).
