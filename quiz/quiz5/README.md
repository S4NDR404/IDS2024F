1. You would read this as "The probability of \( A \) given \( B \)." The meaning of Pi is that it represents probability in a specific notation. The meaning of | is that it indicates "given that," denoting conditional probability.  
2. Classical Probability, Bayesian Probability, Frequentist Probability, Propensity.  
3. Classical Probability, Bayesian Probability.  
4. Frequentist Probability, Propensity.  
5. The Bayesian definition allows it to be based on degrees of belief or prior knowledge. It doesn't require empirical frequency or repeatable experiments.  
6. No, Bayesian inference is a distinct methodology, incorporating prior beliefs and updating probabilities with evidence. Frequentist methods rely solely on observed data without prior beliefs.  
7. Bayesian inference.  
8. Bayesian methods excel in scenarios where experiments are one-off or irreproducible, aligning with many problems in physics and engineering.  
9. Mid-20th century with Kolmogorov's axiomatic.  
10. Frequentist Inference, Bayesian Inference.  
11. Epistemic uncertainty, because the observer's answer led to an incorrect identification.  
12. position, size, shape, color, line size.  
13. Continuous and discrete.  
14. Factors are variables that represent categorical data. Levels are categories or distinct values within a factor.  
15. Continuous: size, color, width, area. discrete: size, color, width, area, shape, color, style.  
16. Factors.  
17. ordered: Quantitative, Numerical. unordered: Qualitative, categorical.  
18. Sequential color scales are best for ordered data like temperature, diverging scales highlight deviations from a midpoint like profit, categorical scales distinguish discrete groups like political parties and cyclic scales represent periodic data like time of day.  
19. 3D perspective makes the plot difficult to read.  
20. Exam scores represent numerical for actual scores or categorical for grade bins (A, B, C).
21. It can be both
22. as
23. The purple and green one are more accessible for color-blind people.
24. asd
25. a. Color to distinguish categories.  
    b. Color to represent data values (sequential)  
    c. Color to represent data values (diverging)  
    d. Color as a tool to highlight
26. as
27. Color as a tool to highlight.
28. The words across the x-axis are diagonal and the bars are too close making it feel crammed.
