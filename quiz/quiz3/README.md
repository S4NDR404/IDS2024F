1. observational data, inverse problem, model conjunction, forward problem, prediction, natural phenomenon.
2. Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data.
3. Theory Replacement is cases where physical theories are difficult to formulate or too complex to solve analytically. Experiment Replacement computation allows virtual experiments that would be too dangerous, expensive, or impossible to perform physically. Hybrid Approach is computation aids both theory and experimentation by refining models or interpreting experimental data.  
4. Deductive *example: (All humans are mortal (general premise). Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal (specific conclusion).* And plausible reasoning *example(Every swan I have seen is white (specific observation). Therefore, all swans are white (general conclusion))*.  
5. Data is a representation of reality that is gathered through observations. However we cannot observe reality directly but as the pyramid of scientific inference suggests data supports hypotheses, which in turn supports theories, leading to a model of reality.
6. Calibration is adjusting model parameters so that the model's output matches experimental data or known results. Validation is testing a calibrated model against new or independent data to ensure its predictions are accurate and reliable in real-world applications.  
7. Logical implication is not the same as physical causation.
Example: "If it rains, the streets are wet" is a logical implication. However, this does not mean the rain physically causes wet streets under all conditions.  
8. George Boole (1854).
